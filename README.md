## Description

Here I have created a personal web page to show off my work in Rutgers Coding Bootcamp thus far. There is a About, Portfolio, and Contact page. At the top right I have also linked my github page, my resume and an email icon to contact me. The final icon in the top right is a game controller icon which directs to a mini Super Mario game.

* In the future I plan on replacing this game with one I will have learned to create myself!
